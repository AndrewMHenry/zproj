This project is a suite of tools designed to ease the process of developing
assembly language apps for the TI-83 Plus series of calculators.


Although the idea of writing an assembler is tempting, there are already so
many options out there, and it would take a considerable amount of time.
Further, this actually exacerbates the portability issue by introducing yet
another assembler syntax.

A better idea might be to write a "preprocessor" that transforms source files
into a single file containing portable assembler source, which could be sent
to an assembler.  This has several advantages:

    (1) A single file could be assembled without regard to include paths.

    (2) The assembler used could be easily swapped out, allowing the user to
        use his assembler of choice and removing dependence on a particular
        assembler.



On the other hand, an even easier solution might be a utility that generates
a Makefile according to user specifications.


zmake

For example, consider a directory tree like the following
hello/
    hello.asm
